This is an introduction to the SVG -- scalable vector graphics -- image format.
It is aimed at people in academia and and how they might most commonly use the format (for figures, papers, presentations, posters, etc).

This tutorial should teach you:

- The basic building blocks of the SVG format
- How to make basic SVGs by hand
- How to more confidently edit SVGs made by software or third parties
- When it is appropriate to make an SVG by hand and when it is not
- General familiarity with the format such that you can more effectively Google a particular problem

It should also serve as a relatively comprehensive reference when you need to look up a particular syntax or method.
